              Imagine you work like normal, as usuall. However, in between your
              work, you can create checkpoints for you to go back to or rewind
              to your previous itteration of your work.
              <strong>That is version control!</strong>

              As previously mention, Git is a software,
              <span class="red-text">do not get it confused with GitHub</span>,
              in which we will learn about as well. Git is a software that you
              install in your local machine to use version control, and GitHub
              is a service provider to host your code remotely.
              <strong>They are different and yet they work together.</strong>

            Now you have to open your <strong>terminal</strong>. But wait,
            you're not one of those pesky Windows user are you? Hmmm? Just
            kidding HaHa... But seriously, it works differently on Windows.

                Once you got Git installed, open your terminal. Don't know what
                a terminal is? Noprob. Go to your desktop search function and
                just type in terminal, and... VoilÃ .

                If you installed Git on Windows, <strong>Git Bash</strong> comes
                included as part of the Git For Windows package. Now, what the
                hell is Git bash?
              </p>
              <br />
              <p>
                Short answer, it is terminal for Windows for you to operate Git.
                Long answer, just look it up online bro, I ain't explaining you
                all dat. My goal is for you to simply understand, not
                complicatedly understand.

                  To launch Git Bash, open the Windows Start menu, type git
                  bash, and press Enter (or click the application icon). It
                  should look something like this ->

            To do that, just type in
            <span class="code-snippet">git --version</span> on your respected

            successfully installed Git to your machine, congrats!

          <h2>Working in the Terminal</h2>
          <p>
            Terminal isn't that scary. Come on, I'll help you dip your toe on
            the terminal ðŸ«±
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            To navigate your file structure in the terminal we use what's called
            the <strong>Linux Commands</strong>.
          </p>
          <p>
            But I use MacOS. Doesn't matter. MacOS stems from Unix OS, which is
            also the root of all Linux distributions.
          </p>
          <p>
            How about Windows? That's what Git Bash is for. Convenient right?
            Now we can work on the same thing!

            Note: folders are called directories or

          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>
                On your terminal, type in <span class="code-snippet">pwd</span>.
                This will tell you your <strong>current location</strong>.
              </p>

                You don't really know what directories are inside of the
                directory you are in right now. What am I talking about, the
                point is, how do you know what is inside. Just type
                <span class="code-snippet">ls</span> and you willsee the
                <strong>list of the directories</strong> and the files inside
                your current location ;)
              </p>
              <br />
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                As you see the list and... there! You have the sudden urge to go
                into that directory and see what's inside. But how? Type
                <span class="code-snippet">cd directory-name</span>, that's cd
                (space) (name of your folder) to
                <strong>move inside the chosen directory</strong>.
              </p>
              <br />
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                To <strong>go back</strong>, simply type
                <span class="code-snippet">cd ..</span>, and if you just type
                <span class="code-snippet">cd</span>, you will be redirected to
                your <strong>home directory</strong>.
              </p>
              <br />
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                You can <strong>create a new directory</strong> by using the
                <span class="code-snippet">mkdir directory-name</span> command!
              </p>
              <br />
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                And to <strong>create a new file</strong>, type in
                <span class="code-snippet">touch file-name.txt</span> or
                <span class="code-snippet">echo file-name.txt</span>. Each file
                has different extention, be sure to match the extention with the
                type you want to create. For example, text file is
                <span class="code-snippet">.txt</span>
              </p>
              <br />
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                What about deleting? Use
                <span class="code-snippet">rm</span> command to
                <strong>remove file or directory</strong>, followed by the file
                or dir name. However, when deleting a non-empty directory, you
                must use the -r <em>flag</em> like so:
                <span class="code-snippet">rm -r dir-name</span>. There's so
                much more about command flags, but we're not gonna dive in
                details. Feel free to look it up though!
              </p>
              <br />

            <li>
              <p>
                Not only you can move items, but
                <strong>moving and renaming items</strong>
                simultaniously can be done by this command:
                <span class="code-snippet">mv (old path) (new path)</span>. For
                example, changing MyFile.txt to MyNewFile.txt and moving it to
                Work folder:
                <span class="code-snippet"
                  >mv ~/Downloads/MyFile.txt
                  ~/Documents/Work/NewFileName.txt</span
                >
              </p>
              <br />
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                <span class="code-snippet">cat</span> command is used to read
                the contents of a file, think of it like "ey lemme see dat real
                quick"-type of thing.
              </p>
              <br />
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Phew... That was a lot. Of course, there are many more commands that
            are not listed here, we are barely scratching the surface. But these
            commands should get you started in becoming a power user of the
            terminal. If in case you don't know what is the purpose of a
            specific command, you can use
            <span class="code-snippet">man (command name)</span>, this is like
            the documentation for all the commands. To exit the man page, just
            <em>press q and it will exit the page</em>. Good luck and have fun!

          <h2>Work with Git</h2>
          <p>
            Go ahead and create a folder with the name of your choosing and move
            to that folder. Remember, just type in
            <span class="code-snippet">mkdir (dir-name)</span> and
            <span class="code-snippet">cd (dir-name)</span>.
          </p>
          <br />
          <h3>Initialize Git</h3>
          <p>
            Git needs to be initialized in order for it to work. To check if Git
            is already initialized, you can use the
            <span class="code-snippet">git status</span> command. We will be
            using this command a lot, I mean A LOT.
          </p>
          <p>
            If it looks something like this means git is not yet initialized:
          </p>
          <img src="images/git/not-init.png" alt="" class="terminal-ss" />
          <p>Initialized git look more or less like this:</p>
          <img src="images/git/init.png" alt="" class="terminal-ss" />
          <p>
            Notice it says branch, and main? What are those? We'll learn about
            them soon.
          </p>
          <br />
          <br />
          <p>
            To initialize Git, type in
            <span class="code-snippet">git init</span>. Nice! You got git set
            up, now the real work begins.
          </p>
          <br />
          <h3>Staging</h3>
          <p>
            Go ahead and create a file or two in your git repository (a git
            initialized directory). Once you've done that, try typing the
            <span class="code-snippet">git status</span> command again and see
            for yourself.
          </p>
          <img src="images/git/staging.png" alt="" class="terminal-ss" />
          <p>
            Now my friends, you've added some files but they are not track by
            Git yet, and the whole point of Git is to "track" progress, no?
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            We now do what's called <strong>Git staging</strong>. It is just to
            add the untracked to get them ready to be a checkpoint.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            To do that, simply use the command
            <span class="code-snippet">git add fileName.txt</span> to stage a
            specific file, or <span class="code-snippet">git add .</span> to
            stage all the files that are pending (in red).
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            Once you've done that, go ahead and see git status again and you'll
            see your files are in green. This means they are
            <strong>staged for commit</strong>, in a ready state to be a check
            point.
          </p>
          <img src="images/git/staged.png" alt="" class="terminal-ss" />
          <br /><br />
          <h3>Git Commit</h3>
          <p>Once your files have been staged, it is time for commit.</p>
          <p>Commit just means "let's make this into a checkpoint now".</p>
          <br />
          <p>
            You need a commit message. The purpose is just so you and the others
            know that at this stage, you've done so and so to the files, just to
            see the timeline of the work progress clearer.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            This is how you commit, by using this command:
            <span class="code-snippet">git commit -m "message here"</span>. Git
            will prompt you to add the message regardless, so yes, it is
            necessary.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            And if you check git status again you'll see that there's nothing to
            stage, nothing to commit, that is until you make some changes to you
            repository.
          </p>
          <br />
          <h3>Branching</h3>
          <div class="firstBlock-git">
            <p>
              At some point you'll work on complicated feature and it has the
              possibility to mess with your entire code. That's where branching
              comes in.
            </p>
            <img src="images/git/git-branch.png" alt="" />
          </div>
          <p>
            Think of it as making another timeline, another alternate universe
            where you can just mess with it and it wouldn't matter because your
            original universe is safe and untouched.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            Type the command <span class="code-snippet">git branch</span> and
            you will see that you are in the branch main (or master).
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            Let's <strong>create a new branch</strong> to work with. You can
            name it whatever you want. Type in
            <span class="code-snippet">git branch newBranchName</span>.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            See which branch you are located right now. Aleady forgot? Use
            <span class="code-snippet">git branch</span>! Git branch is used to
            list all your branches at the same time tells you where you are
            located.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            To jump to another branch or <strong>switch branch</strong>, you can
            use <span class="code-snippet">git checkout branchName</span>. Go
            ahead see where you are now, of course by typing git branch.
          </p>

            Note: If you're working in a specific branch with commited changes,
            the other branches will not be affected so there will be no changes
            in different branches. But you have to commit your changes in the
            branch you're working on, otherwise it'll be pointless. So
            <em>don't forget to commit your changes!</em>

          <h3>Merging</h3>
          <p>
            Great. Now that you've done your work on a separate branch, you want
            all that work to be applied to your main branch, your original
            universe.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            First, please check WHERE YOU ARE right now by typing git branch.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            You always want to be where you want the branch to merge into. In my
            case, I want to merge bug-fix to main. So I move to main and merge
            the bug-fix here. "Hey, bring bug-fix into me, I'm in main!"
          </p>
          <img src="images/git/branch-list.png" alt="" class="terminal-ss" />
          <br />
          <br />
          <p>
            If you are inside the branch you want to merge into, use the command
            <span class="code-snippet">git merge branchName</span>. In my case,
            the branch name is bug-fix.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>That's it!</p>
          <br />
          <h3 class="red-text">Conflict</h3>
          <p>
            More often than not you'll encounter a <strong>conflict</strong>.
            This happens when the branch you are merging have different
            properties, there's discrepancy to be found.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            So... you have to <strong>resolve</strong> it. Decide which you want
            to keep, which to remove, or even keep both changes idk.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            To resolve a conflict, you have to do it manually. Watch out, there
            will be signs that you need to understand! &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;
            means your current changes, &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; means the upcomming
            changes, and ===== is just the divider.
          </p>

          <article class="note">
            Note: To resolve git conflict, you need to remove all the signs
            since their purpose is just to inform you what's what. So be sure to
            remove them. You don't need them in your codebase right?
          </article>
          <br />
          <p>Congrats, you resolved the conflict!!</p>
          <br />

          <p>
            What you've learned here is barely scratching the surface. There's
            still so much more if you wanna dive deep into Git. But for now, 90%
            of your workflow with Git will be what you've just learned. I think
            you're ready to go on your own in your developer journey. See ya ðŸ‘‹
