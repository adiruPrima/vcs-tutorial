              Imagine you work like normal, as usuall. However, in between your
              work, you can create checkpoints for you to go back to or rewind
              to your previous itteration of your work.
              <strong>That is version control!</strong>

              As previously mention, Git is a software,
              <span class="red-text">do not get it confused with GitHub</span>,
              in which we will learn about as well. Git is a software that you
              install in your local machine to use version control, and GitHub
              is a service provider to host your code remotely.
              <strong>They are different and yet they work together.</strong>

            Now you have to open your <strong>terminal</strong>. But wait,
            you're not one of those pesky Windows user are you? Hmmm? Just
            kidding HaHa... But seriously, it works differently on Windows.

                Once you got Git installed, open your terminal. Don't know what
                a terminal is? Noprob. Go to your desktop search function and
                just type in terminal, and... VoilÃ .

                If you installed Git on Windows, <strong>Git Bash</strong> comes
                included as part of the Git For Windows package. Now, what the
                hell is Git bash?
              </p>
              <br />
              <p>
                Short answer, it is terminal for Windows for you to operate Git.
                Long answer, just look it up online bro, I ain't explaining you
                all dat. My goal is for you to simply understand, not
                complicatedly understand.

                  To launch Git Bash, open the Windows Start menu, type git
                  bash, and press Enter (or click the application icon). It
                  should look something like this ->

          <h3>Check if Git is properly installed</h3>
          <p>
            To do that, just type in
            <span class="code-snippet">git --version</span> on your respected
            terminal. If the version numbers showed up, that means you have
            successfully installed Git to your machine, congrats!
          </p>

            If not then you screwed up, man. Just try again, don't give up!!
